Problem Statement: Reporting on Netflix media consumption for various categories across different regions worldwide.

Introduction: This analysis will help you understand how different categories of shows and documentaries offered by Netflix are viewed across the globe. You can also make your choice of what to watch next based on the most liked shows and categories.

Aim: To consolidate data on Netflix and better report on the most liked shows and movies, the production of media and materials, audiences and their most viewed categories.

Data Preparation: Microsoft Excel and Tableau to clean and prepare the data to match the standards for conducting data analysis. In the original dataset, there have been comma-separated values and other variables which needed adjustments, alternatively, some which were not utilised in this analysis have been hidden in the tableau workbook to create usable data for this analysis.

Future Scope: Integrate more recent data resources to update audience preferences, content generation and likeliness of hit/miss content based on most to least preferred genres. More can be analysed in the scope of what content might likely draw more audiences to Netflix region-wise for which location and genre could be analysed further.
