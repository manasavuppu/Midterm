Problem Statement: Reporting on Netflix media consumption for various categories across different regions worldwide

Aim: To consolidate data on Netflix and better report on the most liked shows and movies, the production of media and materials, audiences and their most viewed categories.

Data Preparation: Microsoft Excel and Tableau to clean and prepare the data to match the standards for conducting data analysis.

Future Scope: Integrate more recent data resources to update audience preferences, content generation and likeliness of hit/miss content based on most to least preferred genres. Also focus on better storytelling of one/two categories with in-depth analysis.
